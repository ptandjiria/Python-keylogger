# Python keylogger
This project was mainly done to explore how one can better protect their systems from keylogging attacks and highlight the threat keyloggers provide to user authentication, confidentiality and integrity.

This keylogger uses ‘pynput’ to capture keyboard input, including modifier key combinations. The project also includes an interpreter to reconstruct meaningful text from logged keypresses, periodic log transmission via email every 10 seconds for near real-time data reporting, and addressed the challenge of handling hexadecimal control characters.
